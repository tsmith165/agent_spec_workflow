# Agent Spec Workflow

A collection of prompts and markdown templates designed to enhance LLM task completion accuracy through structured specifications and workflows.

## Overview

This project provides a systematic approach to working with AI agents by establishing a clear specification process. It helps bridge the gap between human requirements and AI task execution by creating detailed, structured specifications that both humans and AI can understand and follow.

## Key Features

-   Standardized specification templates for different project types
-   Step-by-step workflow for creating and maintaining specs
-   Built-in review checkpoints with senior developers
-   Iterative improvement process
-   Clear rules and guidelines for AI agents
