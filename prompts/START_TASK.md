# High Level End Goal

Description of expected state after agent completes all changes

# Implementation details

When creating new files / classes / functions / types, enter high level descriptions of the functionality required and naming conventions to use. Include the full expected file path if doing a refactor or expecting specific file structure.

# Hard Requirements

Bulleted list of extra details required to correctly complete the task. Retry the task with extra info added to this list if the agent fails a task

# Current state (if this is a refactor / feature addition)

Description of the current implementation and @ all current required files for context

Use the @AGENT_SPEC_TEMPLATE.md process for working through the changes required for this. Create `/specs/<TASK_NAME>/<SUB_TASK_NAME>-SPEC.md` and outline this process. Take your time when creating this markdown spec file. Read all files required for context on this and then generate the spec as outlined. Once the SPEC is complete, check in with me (senior dev) so that I can go over the process you have outlined and ensure it is up to expectations. We will continue with implementing these steps once I have reviewed, so ensure that the steps you generate will be detailed in a way that you as an AI agent will be able to understand and complete the required actions.
